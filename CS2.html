    <pre class="description">
        Clear Creek County Advocates was started in the 80's as a 
        victim advocacy resource. They focus on creating a safe space 
        for victims to be able to make their next move forward. Our 
        project focused on re-designing their website to make it more 
        functional and modern. 

        A primary challenge for users was easily finding the pages 
        within the navigation bar. Once they did find the right page, 
        each one was slightly underdeveloped.</pre>

<!-- User Research-->

<section id="userResearch">
    <p class="sectionTitle">Phase 1: User Research</p>
    <img id="researchPic1" src="/Images/researchPic1.png" alt="Card Sort">
    <pre class="description">
        The biggest issue found was the lack of orgnization when it comes to 
        the navigation. The amount of pages and the lack of information on 
        each of them made it hard for the user to find what they were looking 
        for. It also made the user loose trust in the orginazation. Using 
        personas, we were able to find the most likely path through the 
        website and focus on redesigning those pages. The stakeholder 
        interview cleared up the purpose of some of the buttons.

    <p class="sectionTitle">Phase 2: Definition and Synthesis</p>
    <pre class="description">
        The card sort was the most important. It allowed us to see how the user would logically organize 
        all the pages in a way that would make it easily flow for them. Once we had that and some user interviews, 
        we were able to make the next steps of putting it together

    <pre class="description">
        Each box from the user flow was made into a 
        separate screen, except for the Search and 
        Suggestion boxes because they would accomplish 
        the goal of finding a location better if they were 
        paired.

<!--Prototyping-->
<section id="prototyping">
    <p class="sectionTitle">Phase 4: Prototyping</p>
    <pre class="description">
        To start prototyping, rough sketches were created for the 
        "Homepage," "Who are We," and "Suicide Signs & Behaviors" 
        pages. The focus was on designing the header and footer, 
        which were then turned into digital wireframes. These 
        wireframes were refined to meet user requirements for a 
        refreshed look, spaciousness, and ease of use, resulting in the 
        first Clear Creek County Advocates LoFi prototype with added 
        interactions.

<!--User Testing-->
<section id="userTesting">
    <p class="sectionTitle">Phase 5: User Testing</p>
    <pre class="description">
        Users expressed dislikes for sizing and desired better page 
        structure. The project stakeholder approved and was pleased 
        with the prototypes direction. Experimentation was done with 
        hotline and exit site buttons to optimize functionality without 
        being visually intrusive to users. Key improvements made:
        Less spacing through the desktop, so users knew there was 
        more to the page than just one section
        More changes to the desktop header
        Made featured topics reel pagination clickable
        Small Figma interactions were fixed

<!--Future-->
<section id="future">
    <p class="sectionTitle">Phase 6: Future Opportunites</p>
    <pre class="description">
        The design needs more responsive interactions and user testing. Adding graphic elements can enhance visual appeal and 
        reduce whitespace. The new navigation bar has significantly improved organization and clarity. Giving trust back to the users!
        
        The future direcetion of the project could be more simplifying of the website's pages and combining content can enhance user 
        navigation and access to information.
