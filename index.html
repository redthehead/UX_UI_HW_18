        Our Place was primarily a user research project. The goal was 
        to find any gaps in the travel industry, specifically when it 
        comes to finding a place to stay.

        Problem: Finding discounts and deals for travel
        accommodations is exhausting and can feel like a scam.

        Goal: Create a safe and user-friendly app that provides 
        discount information for accommodations when traveling.
        Price comparing became, through research, the easiest and 
        most available way to accomplish this.

        Value proposition: "Our Place" provides price compare to 
        quickly find the best price on accommodations for you.</pre>

        Key takeaways:
        Greatest pain point was the overwhelm people felt when searching for
        good deals
        Most app used to find a place to stay = Airbnb
        People do not want to spend hours trying to find a deal
        This leads to burnout and under-planned trips
        Typically people are not willing to pay for an app or subscription that 
        tells them the best discounts or deals available
        People want a nice place to stay that is comfortable and safe, but still
        allows them to spend their money on experiences 
        They need their necessities covered, but not at the expense of missing
        out on other things they could do, see or eat
        Most discounts for accommodations appear to be a scam
        This scares people off and prevents them from taking the deal

    <pre class="description">
        The features selected to focus on when creating this new app were virtual walkthrough, deal guarantee and side-by-side comparison.
        
        Problem statement: Finding discounted accommodations is near impossible. Travelers typically have a hard time comparing prices and
        finding available discounts. Our vacationers need to easily find inexpensive places to stay while traveling while still meeting their
        needs. This will allow them to spend their time and money on other excursions.

        Each box from the user flow was made into a 
        separate screen, except for the Search and 
        Suggestion boxes because they would accomplish 
        the goal of finding a location better if they were 
        paired.

        The wireframe proposes how the user will be able to easily 
        accomplish the task of finding great deals for travel 
        accommodations and booking them. 
        
        Using the competitor analysis, I was able to combine good 
        ideas and eliminate pain points.

    <p class="sectionTitle">Phase 6: Future Opportunites</p>
    <pre class="description">
        The proto-person shaped the demographics of the people interviewed. The interview’s helped to determine the greatest goals 
        and pain points of a user when it comes to planning trips. 
        
        Focusing in on that information, user’s want viable secure options for places to stay that are well-priced but still meet their 
        needs and don’t overly-compromise in either direction.
        
        The prototype meets the user needs by allowing them multiple options where they can filter for their price range, but also 
        compare the places that intrigued them the most. 
        
        The prototype could be improved by implementing active and inactive states for buttons. Specifically the main “Compare” 
        button; inactive before any places are selected, and active afterward. Clearing up the back button and the pages the user is sent 
        to would also be helpful. For example, when the user is on the Hotel Selection page, the flow back would depend on if the user 
        came from the Favorites page, Compare page or the Search page.
